\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Cutting Aluminium Wires}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Unspool a piece of aluminum wire approximately 4" long, then use a neutral cutting edge to cut the piece off the spool. Repeat 6 times per wirecutters needing to be tested, in our case, 5 wirecutters, resulting in 30 pieces of wire.

<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 1 'wirecuts' Image" src="JPG-Images/Image-05.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Take the newly cut piece of wire and cut directly in the middle of the piece, ideally making two 2" pieces of wire. It is important to track which end of the wire is the AB cut and which is the CD cut. Therefore, a sharpie line across the wire was made to indicate which end the cut would be on before cutting.


<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 2 'Wirecuts' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-06.jpg"> -->
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 2 'Wirecuts' Image 2" src="JPG-Images/Image-07.jpg"> -->
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 2 'Wirecuts' Image 3" src="JPG-Images/Image-10.jpg"> -->

  \item
  After cutting, take a small Ziploc bag, and label it with Test \#, Cut \#, Tool \#, Edge AB/CD, and Date. Then package the pieces of wire.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 2 'Wirecuts' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-11.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Repeat Step 2-3 for each piece of 4" long wire that has been cut.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Scanning Aluminium Wires}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Remove a packaged piece of wire from the Ziploc bag.

  \item
  Secure the piece of wire on the confocal microscope stage using sticky tac. Ensure the wire is stable before scanning.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 2 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-16.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Under the 5x optic, begin by leveling the large edge of the cut. Turning the dial to the right or clockwise can reach the lowest point on the wire, while turning it to the left or counter-clockwise will lead to the highest point. The wire can be shifted left or right based on the perceived high or low point. Additionally, tilting the stage forward and backward can help level the wire. The levelness can be determined by observing how much of the cut is visible. Ideally, all pieces of the wire should be visible without any blurry spots. However, it is common to encounter variations in height throughout the scan, where certain areas consistently appear higher or lower than others.

  \item
  Take the overall photo of the cut under the 5x optic.

  \item
  Switch to the 20x optic and adjust the number of cells needed for scanning accordingly. Typically, four cells are sufficient to cover most scans. However, the number of cells needed may vary depending on the specific side of the scanned cut.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 5 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-17.jpg"> -->
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 5 'Scanning Protocol' Image 2" src="JPG-Images/Image-18.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Rotate the dial to the right or clockwise to locate the lowest point of the cut when using the 20x optic. Continue rotating slightly past that point, which may cause details in the scan to appear slightly fuzzy. For accuracy, all cells should be checked to confirm that the lowest point of the scan has been reached. It may also be necessary to rotate the dial to the left initially. This adjustment compensates for the possibility of the focus being set beyond the low point when switching to the 20x optic.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 6 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-19.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Plant the flag for the scan, indicating to the microscope that the scan will start from this specific location.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 7 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-20.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Rotate the dial to the left or counter-clockwise to locate the highest point of the cut. Continue rotating slightly past that point, which may cause details in the scan to appear slightly fuzzy. A closer Z-value to 0 in the left column indicates a better result. Typically, if this value exceeds 0.100, it indicates that the cut needs to be leveled further.

  \item
  After identifying and slightly passing the highest point, record the first three digits after the decimal point without leading 0s of the Z-value number into the Z-score box located in the right column of the interface. For example, if the Z-value displays '0.0581', '58' should be input into the Z-score box. Adjusting the Z-score communicates to the microscope the desired scanning distance.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 9 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-22.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Turn the dial to the right or clockwise to reset the Z-value to 0.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 10 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-23.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Adjust the light as necessary with the help of the auto light feature represented by a sun icon on the interface.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 11 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-24.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Click the green 'ACQUIRE' button.
<!-- <img width="1031" alt="Step 12 'Scanning Protocol' Image 1" src="JPG-Images/Image-25.jpg"> -->

  \item
  Save the scan with the naming protocol: Wire Cutting Project - Scan \# - Cut \# - Aluminium Wire - (Large/Small) Edge - (Inner/Middle/Outer) Surface - Kaiweets Tool \#(1/2/3/4/5)  - Edge (A/B/C/D) - 20x - Light %.

  \item
  Repeat Step 1-13 for all the pieces of wire.

  Transparent Methods Checklist
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Materials \& reagents:
    Identify commercial suppliers of reagents, instrumentation or kits, when the source is critical to the outcome of the experiments.
    Declare any restrictions on the availability of unique materials (more information here).
    Provide catalogue or clone numbers for all antibodies (if available). For primary antibodies, provide proof of validation for the relevant species and applications.
    
    \item
    Exclusion criteria: If any data or samples were excluded, explain the exclusion criteria and state in the methods whether the criteria were established before the study was conducted.
    
    \item
    Randomization \& blinding: For any studies that involve assigning samples, animals or participants into different groups:
    State clearly whether randomization methods were used. If randomization was not employed, this should be clearly stated.
    State clearly whether blinding was employed during data collection. If blinding was not employed, this should be clearly stated.
    
    \item
    Animal \& human studies (full journal policies here):
    Experiments involving human participants must identify the committee approving the experiments, and include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants.
    Studies employing nonhuman animals should ensure that methods descriptions comply with the ARRIVE checklist.
    
    \item
    Cell lines:
    For each eukaryotic cell line used, state the source and whether the cell line has been authenticated or otherwise tested for integrity.
    If any commonly misidentified cell lines were used (see ICLAC or NCBI Biosample), justify their use.
    Report whether the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination.
    
    \item
    Chemistry \& materials science: Manuscripts describing chemical syntheses, or characterizing new chemicals or materials should refer to the guidance at Nature Chemistry.
    
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{gray}{(unlimited length) The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). See the detailed section in our submission guidelines for advice on writing a transparent and reproducible methods section. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (see Data Records and Citing Data, below).}

\textcolor{gray}{Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods section. Subheadings should not be numbered.}

\textcolor{gray}{Authors should review the transparent methods checklist below, and ensure that their manuscript complies with any relevant points. Authors are also encouraged to search FAIRsharing.org for community reporting standards that may be relevant to their specific data-type.}

\section*{Data Records}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \href{https://iastate.figshare.com/}{ISU DataShare}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{gray}{(unlimited length) The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and to provide an overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data record should be cited numerically in the text of this section, for example \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}, and included in the main reference list as described below. A data citation should also be placed in the subsection of the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record. Providing a direct link to the dataset may also be helpful to readers (\hyperlink{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801}{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801}).}

\textcolor{gray}{Tables should be used to support the data records, and should clearly indicate the samples and subjects (study inputs), their provenance, and the experimental manipulations performed on each (please see 'Tables' below). They should also specify the data output resulting from each data-collection or analytical step, should these form part of the archived record.}

}: \textcolor{gray}{Regular quality assurance inspections are carried out on the Âµ-CT scanner to verify its metrological and geometrical (alignments) accuracy for conducting the scans. The geometry of source to object and source to detector distances are verified whenever there is any significant physical interaction with the source such as re-alignment, change of filament, or source anode change. This calibration process involves scanning a specially designed phantom known as an â€˜hourglassâ€™36, which consists of three pairs of high-sphericity spheres. The sphere sizes are as follows: two spheres with a diameter of 3.000 mm, two spheres with a diameter of 6.000 mm, and two spheres with a diameter of 9.525 mm, and each sphere is kept in contact with its size-counterpart. By using this phantom, it becomes possible to accurately determine a known distance, specifically the centre-to-centre distance of the spheres, in a threshold-independent manner. If the measured distance deviates beyond the acceptable limits of metrological accuracy, the systemâ€™s calibration parameters are adjusted to ensure agreement between the measured distance and the actual distance.}

\section*{Figures \& Tables}


Figures, tables, and their legends, should be included at the end of the document. Figures and tables can be referenced in \LaTeX{} using the ref command, e.g. Figure \ref{fig:stream} and Table \ref{tab:example}. 

Authors are encouraged to provide one or more tables that provide basic information on the main â€˜inputsâ€™ to the study (e.g. samples, participants, or information sources) and the main data outputs of the study. Tables in the manuscript should generally not be used to present primary data (i.e. measurements). Tables containing primary data should be submitted to an appropriate data repository.

Tables may be provided within the \LaTeX{} document or as separate files (tab-delimited text or Excel files). Legends, where needed, should be included here. Generally, a Data Descriptor should have fewer than ten Tables, but more may be allowed when needed. Tables may be of any size, but only Tables which fit onto a single printed page will be included in the PDF version of the article (up to a maximum of three). 

Due to typesetting constraints, tables that do not fit onto a single A4 page cannot be included in the PDF version of the article and will be made available in the online version only. Any such tables must be labelled in the text as â€˜Online-onlyâ€™ tables and numbered separately from the main table list e.g. â€˜Table 1, Table 2, Online-only Table 1â€™ etc.
