abstract: |
 Wire cut data is important in forensic investigations but lacks a systematic way of analyzing the data.
 We created a data set of 120 scans of aluminum wire cut in \texttt{x3p} format,
 using 5 wire cutters and 3 locations along the 4 blades,
 with 2 replicates for each combination.
 A systematic pipeline with multiple analysis plots was developed to analyze the data and draw conclusions based on numerical measures.

\section*{Background \& Summary}

Wire cut data is a type of forensic tool mark data used to identify the source of a wire cutter based on the striations left on the surface.
There have been cases \textcolor{red}{(don't mention the name?)}
where the wire cut data played a crucial role in the criminal investigation.
However,
there is a lack of a standardized method to analyze it except for visual comparison.
Here,
we provide a data set of 120 scans of aluminum wire cut in \texttt{x3p} format,
and we conduct a technical validation to introduce a systematic pipeline for analyzing these types of data based on numerical measures.
We hope this pipeline developed using this data set can be further generalized and applied to real crime scenes to help investigators draw conclusions based on real wire cut data.

\section*{Methods}

In this study,
aluminum wire was used to create an optimal scenario where the most amount of information could be transferred from the tool to the substrate,
despite the wire in some real cases being made of lead.
The aluminum wire used was 16 Gauge/1.5 mm, anodized.

In order to cut the wire,
4-inch pieces were unspooled and cut using Kaiweets wire cutters,
model KWS-105,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig: cut-tent-scan}(a),
for 1 blade location,
either inner, middle, or outer,
which gives us 1 replicate.
Each piece was then cut into half to create 2-inch pieces for each side,
AB and CD,
with a sharpie line marking the cut ends,
giving us 4 samples.
Here,
we are showing AB sides only in Figure \ref{fig: cut-tent-scan}(b)
\textcolor{red}{(need a different tent figure)},
and the CD sides are similar from the other side of the cut,
with the back of A being C and the back of B being D.
Both AB and CD sides form tent structures on the tips of the wire,
and we can separate each side of the tent into 2 pieces along the bending position,
resulting in 8 scans.
We repeated this process for all 3 locations along the blade and 5 wire cutters,
with 2 replicates for each tool-edge-location combination,
resulting in 120 scans.
Each piece was labeled with the naming conventions,
T(ool) 1/2/3/4/5 (Edge) A/B/C/D W(ire) - L(ocation) I(nner)/M(iddle)/O(uter) -  R(epetition) 1/2,
with T1AW-LI-R1 being the piece cut by tool 1 on the A edge at the inner location for the first repetition.

A more detailed procedure,
including standard scanning protocols for the confocal microscope in Figure \ref{fig: cut-tent-scan}(c)
\textcolor{red}{(need an extra pic of the very tip)},
can be found in the
\href{https://github.com/heike/Wirecuts/blob/main/README.md}{README of the GitHub repository \texttt{heike/Wirecuts}} \textcolor{red}{(High-res pics needed in the README)}.
The scanned surfaces are saved in a resolution of $0.645 \mu m \times 0.645 \mu m$ per square pixel in an \texttt{x3p} file format.

\fi



\section*{Technical Validation}

For the data collection process,
two team members did the cutting and labeling together,
then one person did the scanning and named according to the naming convention above. The scanning was done in a specific order to ensure consistency across all scans.
The data was saved in a consistent format to ensure they could be easily accessed and analyzed.
A third person then checked the data to ensure that the data was consistent in naming and accurate.

We also conduct numerical comparisons between 2 replicates made by the same side of the same tool at the same location.
For example,
we compare T1AW-LI-R1 to T1AW-LI-R2,
T1CW-LI-R1 to T1CW-LI-R2,
and so on.
That is comparing each row in Figure \ref{fig: scans_pair}.
The comparison is done by
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  manually extracting profiles from scans,

  \item
  obtaining the filtered signals from scans,
  
  \item
  aligning signals and computing the cross-correlation function (CCF) values.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Extract profiles}

A representative function with the most information is considered as a signal for one scan,
which can be used for comparison later.
To obtain this function,
we first need a profile of the scan,
which is a sequence of values along a user-drawn line on the surface.
The profile should capture most features of the scan,
and be orthogonal to the striation marks of the scan,
which are formed by ups and downs of grooves.
So,
we draw the line across the wide region of the scan to maximize the feature captured,
as shown in dark blue in Figure \ref{fig: T1AW-LI-R1-profiles-signals}(a).
We can then investigate the values under this profile line.
The profile function is along the line is plotted in Figure \ref{fig: T1AW-LI-R1-profiles-signals}(b).


\subsection*{Filtered signals}

With the profile extracted,
we can then obtain the signal.
Two Gaussian filters are applied to these resulting profiles.
In particular,
we first used a large low-pass filter with bandwidths of 400 microns to remove large trend,
as it can overwhelm the signals,
and then used a small high-pass filter of 40 microns to average across noise and remove spikes,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig: T1AW-LI-R1-profiles-signals}(c).
\textcolor{red}{(add reference: W. S. Cleveland, E. Grosse and W. M. Shyu (1992) Local regression models. Chapter 8 of Statistical Models in S eds J.M. Chambers and T.J. Hastie, Wadsworth \& Brooks/Cole.)}.
Finally,
the extreme tail values are removed.


\subsection*{Align signals and compute the cross-correlation function (CCF) values}

Signals extracted from different scans can be put together for comparison,
and we maximize the overlapping region of the signals by aligning them.
We know that signals from two replicates with the same tool-edge-location combination should yield similar signalsï¼Œ
as in the first and second column of Figure \ref{fig: signals_pair_alignment},
which will give alignments of massive overlapping and high CCF values close to 1.
The alignments and values we got in the rightmost column of Figure \ref{fig: signals_pair_alignment} fulfill our expectations.

}: \textcolor{gray}{Regular quality assurance inspections are carried out on the Âµ-CT scanner to verify its metrological and geometrical (alignments) accuracy for conducting the scans. The geometry of source to object and source to detector distances are verified whenever there is any significant physical interaction with the source such as re-alignment, change of filament, or source anode change. This calibration process involves scanning a specially designed phantom known as an â€˜hourglassâ€™36, which consists of three pairs of high-sphericity spheres. The sphere sizes are as follows: two spheres with a diameter of 3.000 mm, two spheres with a diameter of 6.000 mm, and two spheres with a diameter of 9.525 mm, and each sphere is kept in contact with its size-counterpart. By using this phantom, it becomes possible to accurately determine a known distance, specifically the centre-to-centre distance of the spheres, in a threshold-independent manner. If the measured distance deviates beyond the acceptable limits of metrological accuracy, the systemâ€™s calibration parameters are adjusted to ensure agreement between the measured distance and the actual distance.}

\section*{Usage Notes}

The data set can be easily accessed with the \texttt{CRAN} \texttt{R} package \texttt{x3ptools}.
Further analysis can be conducted with the \texttt{GitHub} \texttt{R} package \texttt{wire} and the \texttt{GitHub} \texttt{R} shiny app \texttt{wireShiny}
\textcolor{red}{(citation)}.
We already conduct between-replicate comparisons in the technical validation section,
and we can also conduct across-replicate comparisons to establish error rates threshold and produce other analysis plots.

Suppose we put the CCF values in a tilemap with different tool, location and edge combinations.
In that case,
we expect only the diagonal to have high CCF values,
close to 1 and marked as orange in the tilemap,
as the diagonal represents the same source,
and the rest of the matrix to have low CCF values,
close to 0 and marked as gray.
In Figure \ref{fig: ccf_tilemap},
the behavior is consistent with our expectation overall,
except for some rare cases with tool 5 edge D,
which is caused by
\textcolor{red}{?????}.
We also put the resulting CCFs in the boxplot,
as in Figure \ref{fig: ccf_boxplot}.
We can see that the CCF values for the same sources are close to 1,
while the CCF values for different sources are much lower than expected.
This difference can be used to establish a threshold for CCF and help us draw conclusions about the similarity between wire cut scans numerically,
which can be used in real crime scenes.
The density plot in Figure \ref{fig: ccf_density} shows the distribution of the CCF values with the same sources and different sources.
The overlapping points between the tails of these two distributions can be a rough threshold.
Furthermore,
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in Figure \ref{fig: ccf_ROC} shows the sensitivity / true positive rate against the false positive rate (FPR) (1 - specificity).
The curve is very close to the upper left corner,
which is excellent for classification and drawing conclusion.
It gives us a true threshold of 0.589 to control the FPR to be less than 0.05 with false negative rate (FNR) to be 0,
\textcolor{red}{(false positive rate (FPR) / false discovery rate (FDR) -> define the H0 or call it false identification rate (FIR)???)},
and 0.658 to control the FPR to be less than 0.01,
with FNR to be 0.02.
