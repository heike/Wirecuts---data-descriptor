\section*{Methods}

In this study,
aluminum wire was used to create an optimal scenario where the most amount of information could be transferred from the tool to the substrate,
despite the wire in James Genrich’s case being made of lead.
The aluminum wire used was 16 Gauge/1.5 mm, anodized.

To cut the wire,
4-inch pieces were unspooled and cut using Kaiweets wire cutters,
model KWS-105,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig: kaiweet-label},
for 1 blade location,
either inner, middle, or outer,
which gives us 1 replicate.
Each piece was then cut into half to create 2-inch pieces for each side,
AB and CD,
with a sharpie line marking the cut ends,
giving us 4 samples.
Both AB and CD sides form tent structures,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig: x3p_tent},
and we can separate each side of the tent into 2 pieces,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig: T1W},
resulting in 8 scans.
We repeated this process for all 3 locations along the blade and 5 wire cutters,
with 2 replicates for each tool-edge-location combination,
resulting in 120 scans.
Each piece was labeled with the naming conventions,
T(ool) 1/2/3/4/5 (Edge) A/B/C/D W(ire) - L(ocation) I(nner)/M(iddle)/O(uter) -  R(epetition) 1/2,
with T1AW-LI-R1 being the piece cut by tool 1 on the A edge at the inner location for the first repetition.

A more detailed procedure,
including standard scanning protocols for the confocal microscope in Figure \ref{fig: wire-microscope},
can be found in the
\href{https://github.com/heike/Wirecuts/blob/main/README.md}{README of the GitHub repository \texttt{heike/Wirecuts}} \textcolor{red}{(High-res pics needed in the README)}.
The scanned surfaces are saved in a resolution of $0.645 \mu m \times 0.645 \mu m$ per square pixel in an \texttt{x3p} file format.

\textcolor{gray}{(unlimited length) The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). See the detailed section in our submission guidelines for advice on writing a transparent and reproducible methods section. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (see Data Records and Citing Data, below).}

\textcolor{gray}{Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods section. Subheadings should not be numbered.}

\textcolor{gray}{Authors should review the transparent methods checklist below, and ensure that their manuscript complies with any relevant points. Authors are also encouraged to search FAIRsharing.org for community reporting standards that may be relevant to their specific data-type.}

Transparent Methods Checklist
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Materials \& reagents:
  Identify commercial suppliers of reagents, instrumentation or kits, when the source is critical to the outcome of the experiments.
  Declare any restrictions on the availability of unique materials (more information here).
  Provide catalogue or clone numbers for all antibodies (if available). For primary antibodies, provide proof of validation for the relevant species and applications.
  
  \item
  Exclusion criteria: If any data or samples were excluded, explain the exclusion criteria and state in the methods whether the criteria were established before the study was conducted.
  
  \item
  Randomization \& blinding: For any studies that involve assigning samples, animals or participants into different groups:
  State clearly whether randomization methods were used. If randomization was not employed, this should be clearly stated.
  State clearly whether blinding was employed during data collection. If blinding was not employed, this should be clearly stated.
  
  \item
  Animal \& human studies (full journal policies here):
  Experiments involving human participants must identify the committee approving the experiments, and include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants.
  Studies employing nonhuman animals should ensure that methods descriptions comply with the ARRIVE checklist.
  
  \item
  Cell lines:
  For each eukaryotic cell line used, state the source and whether the cell line has been authenticated or otherwise tested for integrity.
  If any commonly misidentified cell lines were used (see ICLAC or NCBI Biosample), justify their use.
  Report whether the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination.
  
  \item
  Chemistry \& materials science: Manuscripts describing chemical syntheses, or characterizing new chemicals or materials should refer to the guidance at Nature Chemistry.

\section*{Data Records}

The complete data set is available on the ISU DataShare repository at \href{https://iastate.figshare.com/}{https://iastate.figshare.com/},
which is public and open access for every interested researcher.
The data set consists of 120 scans in the \texttt{x3p} file format with the naming convention as described before.
\textcolor{red}{Explain the x3p header info to some extent? x3ptools?}

\textcolor{gray}{(unlimited length) The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and to provide an overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data record should be cited numerically in the text of this section, for example \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}, and included in the main reference list as described below. A data citation should also be placed in the subsection of the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record. Providing a direct link to the dataset may also be helpful to readers (\hyperlink{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801}{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.853801}).}

\textcolor{gray}{Tables should be used to support the data records, and should clearly indicate the samples and subjects (study inputs), their provenance, and the experimental manipulations performed on each (please see 'Tables' below). They should also specify the data output resulting from each data-collection or analytical step, should these form part of the archived record.}



\section*{Technical Validation}

For the data collection process,
two team members did the cutting and labeling together,
then one person did the scanning and named according to the naming convention above. The scanning was done in a specific order to ensure consistency across all scans.
The data was saved in a consistent format to ensure that they could be easily accessed and analyzed.
A third person then checked the data to ensure that the data was consistent in naming and accurate.

We also conduct numerical comparisons between 2 replicates made by the same side of the same tool at the same location.
For example,
we compare T1AW-LI-R1 to T1AW-LI-R2,
T1BW-LI-R1 to T1BW-LI-R2,
and so on,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig: scans_pair}.
The comparison is done by aligning the two scans and the cross-correlation function (CCF) between the two scans.
\textcolor{red}{Explain the manual extraction in details? explain striations, profiles, signals, etc?}
We know that signals from two replicates with the same tool-edge-location combination should yield similar signals,
which results in high CCF values close to 1,
and the values we got in Figure \ref{fig: signals_pair_alignment} achieve our expectation.
For validation of all other pairs of scan replicates,
see the detailed \href{https://heike.github.io/Wirecuts/data-descriptor/Technical_Validation.html}{report}.

}: \textcolor{gray}{Regular quality assurance inspections are carried out on the µ-CT scanner to verify its metrological and geometrical (alignments) accuracy for conducting the scans. The geometry of source to object and source to detector distances are verified whenever there is any significant physical interaction with the source such as re-alignment, change of filament, or source anode change. This calibration process involves scanning a specially designed phantom known as an ‘hourglass’36, which consists of three pairs of high-sphericity spheres. The sphere sizes are as follows: two spheres with a diameter of 3.000 mm, two spheres with a diameter of 6.000 mm, and two spheres with a diameter of 9.525 mm, and each sphere is kept in contact with its size-counterpart. By using this phantom, it becomes possible to accurately determine a known distance, specifically the centre-to-centre distance of the spheres, in a threshold-independent manner. If the measured distance deviates beyond the acceptable limits of metrological accuracy, the system’s calibration parameters are adjusted to ensure agreement between the measured distance and the actual distance.}

\section*{Usage Notes}

The data set can be easily accessed with the \texttt{CRAN} \texttt{R} package \texttt{x3ptools}.
Further analysis can be conducted with the \texttt{GitHub} \texttt{R} package \texttt{wire} and the \texttt{GitHub} \texttt{R} shiny app \texttt{wireShiny}.
We already conduct between-replicate comparisons in the technical validation section,
and we can also conduct across-replicate comparisons to establish error rates threshold and produce other analysis plots.
The resulting CCFs are shown in the boxplot in Figure \ref{fig: ccf_boxplot}.
We can see that the CCF values for the same sources are close to 1,
while the CCF values for different sources are much lower.
This difference can be used to establish a threshold for CCF and help us draw conclusion about the similarity between wire cut scans,
which can be used in real crime scenes.
The density plot in Figure \ref{fig: ccf_density} shows the distribution of the CCF values.
The overlapping points between the two distributions can be a rough threshold.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in Figure \ref{fig: ccf_ROC} shows the true positive rate against the false positive rate,
gives us a true threshold of 0.589 to control the false positive rate (FPR) to be less than 0.05,
and 0.658 to control the FPR to be less than 0.01.

Please see our code availability policy for advice on supplying custom code alongside Data Descriptor manuscripts.}

\textcolor{gray}{For studies involving privacy or safety controls on public access to the data, this section should describe in detail these controls, including how authors can apply to access the data, what criteria will be used to determine who may access the data, and any limitations on data use.} 



\section*{Code availability}

\textcolor{gray}{For all studies using custom code in the generation or processing of datasets, a statement must be included under the heading "Code availability", indicating whether and how the code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section should also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset.}
