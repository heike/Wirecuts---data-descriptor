Wire cut data is important in forensic investigations but lacks a
systematic way of analyzing the data. We created a dataset of 120 scans
of aluminum wire cut in \texttt{x3p} format, using 5 wire cutters and 3
locations along the 4 blades, with 2 replicates for each combination. A
systematic pipeline with multiple analysis plots was developed to
analyze the data and draw conclusions based on numerical measures.

\section*{Background \& Summary}\label{sec-background-summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background \& Summary}

An important aspect of forensic analysis involves investigating marks
left at crime scenes. Forensic examiners focus particularly on
identifying the origin of these marks, a process known as the Source
Identification Problem in Forensic Science \hh{citation?}. The forensic
science community generally distinguishes between the \textbf{specific
source problem}, where the examiner seeks to determine whether a mark
was left by a particular tool, and \textbf{the common source problem},
which focuses on whether two marks were left by the same tool.
Currently, accepted practice in both of these two problems relies on
visual inspection of the items under a comparison microscope. The
results, according to the Theory of Identification \citep{afte}
developed by the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners (AFTE),
are categorized by examiner into three types: \emph{identification},
where the marks are believed to have been made by the same source;
\emph{elimination}, where the marks are believed to have been made by
different tools; and \emph{inconclusive}, where similiarities or
dissimilarities between the marks are insufficient to allow either an
identification or an elimination. However, this assessment is inherently
subjective, which has led to criticism from reports by the National
Research Council (NRC) \citep{nas2009} and the President's Council of
Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) \citep{pcast} for lacking
quantifiable measures of objectivity and the absence of error rates.
Such limitations highlight the need for empirical datasets with known
ground truth to validate conclusions. Addressing this gap requires a
structured approach that not only evaluates examiner performance but
also considers case-specific evidence in a measurable way. To bridge
this gap, it is necessary to establish a framework that integrates both
empirical validation of examiner performance and measurable analysis of
case-specific evidence. A crucial aspect of this framework is
recognizing different methodological perspectives in forensic science.

In this context, Biedermann
\citep{biedermannStrangePersistenceSource2022} differentiates between
internal and external perspectives in the forensic literature. The
external perspective only allows general statements based on (black-box)
studies relating examiners' conclusions to ground truth without
considering any evidence of a particular case. To allow an internal
perspective, there is a need to quantitatively capture the basis for an
evaluation based on specific evidence. To transition toward an internal
perspective, similarity comparisons are needed. However, no publicly
available dataset currently exists for wirecut marks. The closest work
is by Baiker et al. \citep{baikerToolmarkVariabilityQuality2015a}, which
focuses on screwdriver toolmarks, not wire cutters. Thus, there is an
urgent need to collect and analyze public datasets specific to wirecut
marks.

Understanding the characteristics of toolmarks left by wire cutters is
essential. When a bladed tool cuts a wire, it leaves striations on the
cut surface, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-cut-microscope}. These
striations serve as evidence to assess the similarity. There have been
cases where the evidence and testimony on wire cut evidence played a
crucial role in the criminal investigation and conviction of a
defendant. However, forensic analysis of these evidence lacks a
standardized quantitative approach, except for visual comparisons.

\caption{\label{fig-cut-microscope}Microscopic close-up of striations

\end{figure}%

A growing of research has sought to develop quantitative methods for
analyzing forensic toolmarks, particularly those created by different
types of tools. Prior studies on striated toolmarks provide insights
into key comparison factors, including angle of attack
\citep{baikerToolmarkVariabilityQuality2015a}, rotational axis
\citep{garciaInfluenceAxialRotation2017}, and cutting direction
\citep{cuellarAlgorithmForensicToolmark2024}. Foundational research in
forensic toolmarks has emphasized dataset collection and computational
analysis. Ma et al. \citep{maNISTBulletSignature2004} and Zheng et al.
\citep{zhengNISTBallisticsToolmark2016} focused on collecting and
distributing datasets for bullet and toolmark analysis for this purpose.
Chu et al. \citep{chuAutomaticIdentificationBullet2013} and Vorburger et
al. \citep{vorburgerApplicationsCrosscorrelationFunctions2011}
demonstrated numerical methods for improving accuracy and consistency.
Hare et al. \citep{hareAutomaticMatchingBullet2017} and Ju et al.
\citep{juJournalOpenSourceImplementation2022} developed similarity
quantification techniques, but alignment remains a major challenge.

In this study, we build on these methodologies to provide a publicly
available dataset of wirecut scans, develop a systematic pipeline to
analyze the data quantitatively, and introduce numerical measures for
similarity assessment beyond visual inspection. The dataset includes
multiple types of files, as summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-data-overview}.

\section*{Methods}\label{sec-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

In this study, we use aluminium wire
\hh{more details: thickness, brand?} to create cuts. The physical
property of aluminum wire makes it an excellent candidate for keeping
marks while being relatively easy to bend and non-toxic, i.e.~with a
hardness of XXX aluminium is soft enough that tools leave marks, but
hard enough to not be affected by handling cut materials under the
microscope.

\hh{XXX look up the hardness value of aluminium, copper and lead. } In
real casework, aluminium wires are not seen as often as lead or copper.
We avoided using lead in the laboratory setting, because of its
toxicity.

\subsection*{Cutting Wires}\label{sec-cutting-wires}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cutting Wires}

The aluminum wire used was 16 Gauge/1.5 mm, anodized. In order to cut
the wire, 4-inch pieces were unspooled and cut using Kaiweets wire
cutters, model KWS-105, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-plier-tip}, for 1
blade location, either inner, middle, or outer, which gives us 1
replicate. Each piece was then cut into half to create 2-inch pieces for
each side, AB and CD, with a sharpie line marking the cut ends, giving
us 4 samples. Then, we use the standard scanning protocols for the
confocal microscope, shown in Figure Figure~\ref{fig-wire-microscope},
to scan the wire tip surfaces. The scanned surfaces are saved in a
resolution of \(0.645 \mu m \times 0.645 \mu m\) per square pixel in an
\texttt{x3p} file format. Here, we are showing AB and CD sides in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R2-4edges}, with the back of A being C and the
back of B being D. Both AB and CD sides form tent structures on the tips
of the wire, and we separate each side of the tent into 2 pieces along
the bending position, resulting in 8 scans. We repeated this process for
all 3 locations along the blade and 5 wire cutters, with 2 replicates
for each tool-edge-location combination, resulting in 120 scans. Each
piece was labeled with the naming conventions, T(ool) 1/2/3/4/5 (Edge)
A/B/C/D W(ire) - L(ocation) I(nner)/M(iddle)/O(uter) - R(epetition) 1/2,
with T1AW-LI-R1 being the piece cut by tool 1 on the A edge at the inner
location for the first repetition.

\subsection*{Extract Profiles}\label{sec-extract-profiles}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Extract Profiles}

Numerical comparisons between 2 replicates cannot be done directly on
the \texttt{x3p} files. We need to extract representative functions from
the scans first. A representative function with the most information is
considered as a signal for one scan, which is used later for comparison.
To obtain this function, we first need a profile of the scan, which is a
sequence of values along a user-drawn line on the surface. The profile
captures most features of the scan and be orthogonal to the striation
marks of the scan, which are formed by the ups and downs of grooves. So,
we draw the line across the wide region of the scan to maximize the
feature captured, as shown in dark blue in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-profiles}. We then investigate the values
under this profile line. The profile function along the line is plotted
in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-profiles-plot}.

\subsection*{Filtered Signals}\label{sec-filtered-signals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Filtered Signals}

With the profile extracted, we then obtain the signal. Two Gaussian
filters, as discussed in Cleveland et al.
\citep{clevelandLocalRegressionModels1992}, are applied to these
resulting profiles. In particular, we first used a large low-pass filter
with bandwidths of 400 microns to remove the large trend, as it
overwhelms the signals, and then used a small high-pass filter of 40
microns to average across noise and remove spikes, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-signals-plot}. Finally, the extreme tail
values are removed.

\end{figure}%

\subsection*{Align Signals}\label{sec-align-signals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Align Signals}

Signals extracted from different scans are put together for comparison,
and we maximize the cross-correlation function (CCF) values between the
signals to find the best alignment numerically. For example, we compare
T1AW-LI-R1 to T1AW-LI-R2, T1CW-LI-R1 to T1CW-LI-R2, and so on. That is
comparing each row in Figure \ref{fig-scans-pair}. We know that signals
from two replicates with the same tool-edge-location combination yield
similar signalsï¼Œ as in the first and second columns of Figure
\ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment}, which results in alignments of massive
overlapping and high CCF values close to 1. The alignments and values we
got in the rightmost column of Figure \ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment}
fulfill our expectations.

\section*{Technical Validation}\label{sec-technical-validation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Technical Validation}

For the data collection process, two team members did the cutting and
labeling together, then one person did the scanning and named according
to the naming convention introduced in
\hyperref[sec-cutting-wires]{Cutting Wires}. The scanning was done in a
specific order to ensure consistency across all scans. The data was
saved in a consistent format to ensure easy of access for analysis. A
third person then checked the data to ensure that the data was
consistent in naming and accurate.

We examined how the data acquisition process influences variability in
the final scans saved in \texttt{x3p}. For this, we arbitrarily selected
scans from tool 2 at location middle. First, we obtained the average CCF
between replicates (replicate 1 and replicate 2) through pairwise
comparison. Then, we rescanned replicate 2 under the confocal
microscope, introducing a new staging labeled as S. Staging 1 for
replicate 2 is omitted in the label, resulting in R2(-S1). For all four
edges of tool 2 at location middle, we created three different stagings:
R2, R2-S2, and R2-S3, and computed the average CCF between stagings
using pairwise comparison.

Within each staging, we further examined the effect of different
acquisitions by keeping the scans on the confocal microscope under
varying lighting conditions, introducing a new acquisition label as A.
For edge A at staging 3, we performed four acquisitions in total,
omitting the first one in the label again, resulting in R2-S3(-A1). For
the other three edges, we conducted two acquisitions in staging 3,
denoted as R2-S3 and R2-S3-A2. The average CCF between acquisitions was
then obtained through pairwise comparison.

With this setup, we expect increasing consistency in the CCF from
replicate to staging to acquisition, as conditions become progressively
more stable. Consequently, variability should decrease along this
sequence. We also computed the differences between replicate, staging,
and acquisition, expecting smaller differences between acquisition and
staging compared to those between staging and replicate. The results,
shown in Table~\ref{tbl-CCF-replicate-staging-acquisition}, confirm our
expectations.

For the validation of the scans and their processing, we investigate the
correlation scores of pairwise aligned signals. Large scores between
signals are indicative of being made by the same tool. As shown
previously in Figure \ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment} in
\hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals}, we expect a high
correlation score between signals from scans of wires cut with the same
tool. For signals from scans of wires cut with a different tool, we
expect a low correlation score. For example, we have two scans from
different tools, T1AW-LI-R1 and T2AW-LI-R1, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1} and Figure~\ref{fig-T2AW-LI-R1}. The
alignment is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-T2AW-LI-R1} with a 0.2
CCF value, which is low, as expected.

We also put resulting CCFs for all pairwise comparisions in the boxplot,
together with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as in
Figure \ref{fig-ccf-boxplot} and Figure \ref{fig-ccf-ROC}. The CCF
values for the same sources are close to 1, while the CCF values for
different sources are much lower than expected. This is consistent with
our expectations and validates our data processing pipeline.

The sphere sizes are as follows: two spheres with a diameter of 3.000 mm, two spheres with a diameter of 6.000 mm, and two spheres with a diameter of 9.525 mm, and each sphere is kept in contact with its size-counterpart. By using this phantom, it becomes possible to accurately determine a known distance, specifically the centre-to-centre distance of the spheres, in a threshold-independent manner. If the measured distance deviates beyond the acceptable limits of metrological accuracy, the systemâ€™s calibration parameters are adjusted to ensure agreement between the measured distance and the actual distance.}

We already conduct pairwise comparisons and visualize some of the
comparison results in \hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals} and
\hyperref[sec-technical-validation]{Technical Validation}, and other
analysis plots as well.

Suppose we put the CCF values in a tilemap with different tools,
locations and edge combinations. In that case, we expect only the
diagonal to have high CCF values, close to 1 and marked as orange in the
tilemap, as the diagonal represents the same source, and the rest of the
matrix to have low CCF values, close to 0 and marked as gray. In Figure
\ref{fig-ccf-tilemap}, the behavior is consistent with our expectation
overall, except for some rare cases with tool 5 edge D. The density plot
in Figure \ref{fig-ccf-density} shows the distribution of the CCF values
with the same sources and different sources. The overlapping points
between the tails of these two distributions to be a rough threshold.

Furthermore, the ROC curve in Figure \ref{fig-ccf-ROC} shows the
sensitivity / true positive rate against the false positive rate (FPR)
(1 - specificity). The curve is very close to the upper left corner,
which is excellent for classification and drawing conclusions. It gives
us a true threshold of 0.589 to control the FPR to be less than 0.05
with a false negative rate (FNR) to be 0,
\tom{(false positive rate (FPR) / false discovery rate (FDR) -> define the H0 or call it false identification rate (FIR)???)},
and 0.658 to control the FPR to be less than 0.01, with FNR to be 0.02.
