Wire cut data is important in forensic investigations but lacks a
systematic way of analyzing the data. We created a data set of 120 scans
of aluminum wire cut in \texttt{x3p} format, using 5 wire cutters and 3
locations along the 4 blades, with 2 replicates for each combination. A
systematic pipeline with multiple analysis plots was developed to
analyze the data and draw conclusions based on numerical measures.

\section*{Background \& Summary}\label{sec-background-summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background \& Summary}

Wire cut data is a type of forensic tool mark data used to identify the
source of a wire cutter based on the striations left on the surface.
There have been cases where the evidence and testimony on wire cut
evidence played a crucial role in the criminal investigation and
conviction of a defendant.

However, there is a lack of a standardized method to analyze it except
for visual comparison. Although the Association of Firearm and Toolmark
Examiners (AFTE) developed the Theory of Identification \citep{afte},
which outlines the process of comparing tool marks, it is still
subjective and relies on the examiner's experience, making results hard
to reproduce and validate. Several reports, such as those from the
National Research Council \citep{nas2009} and the President's Council of
Advisors on Science and Technology \citep{pcast}, pointed out the
abovementioned issues and called for more objective and reproducible
methods to analyze tool marks. Early research by Ma et al.
\citep{maNISTBulletSignature2004} and Zheng et al.
\citep{zhengNISTBallisticsToolmark2016} has focused on collecting and
distributing datasets for this purpose and providing a foundation for
future advancements in tool mark analysis. Studies such as those by Chu
et al. \citep{chuAutomaticIdentificationBullet2013} and Vorburger et al.
\citep{vorburgerApplicationsCrosscorrelationFunctions2011} have
demonstrated the efficacy of using numerical methods to improve accuracy
and consistency in tool mark analysis. Hare et al.
\citep{hareAutomaticMatchingBullet2017} and Ju et al.
\citep{juJournalOpenSourceImplementation2022} have explored methods for
quantifying the similarity between representative signals, but alignment
remains a major hurdle.

In this study, we would like to follow the same path and provide a data
set of wire cut scans, and also discuss a systematic pipeline to analyze
the data and draw conclusions based on numerical measures. Here, we
provide a data set containing multiple files, as described in
Table~\ref{tbl-data-overview}.

For the reproducibility of all our data and alignment results, we
introduce in detail in \hyperref[sec-cutting-wires]{Cutting Wires}
\tom{hyperlink location incorrect for unnumbered sections} how we cut
the wire and collect the 120 scans with 5 tools on 3 locations, in
\hyperref[sec-extract-profiles]{Extract Profiles} how we extract
profiles from the scans, in \hyperref[sec-filtered-signals]{Filtered
Signals} how we filter signals from the profiles, in
\hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals} how we align signals from
different scans and optimize the alignment with the cross-correlation
function (CCF) values. In \hyperref[sec-data-records]{Data Records}, we
discuss where our data is held. Then, in
\hyperref[sec-technical-validation]{Technical Validation}, a technical
validation was conducted to further compare signals from different
sources also match our assumption, together with visual aids for drawing
conclusions. Finally, in \hyperref[sec-usage-notes]{Usage Notes}, we
provide available codes for creating the data set and conducting
technical validation, as discussed in \hyperref[sec-methods]{Methods}
and \hyperref[sec-technical-validation]{Technical Validation}.
\hyperref[sec-code-availability]{Code availability} discusses where
these codes can be found online. We hope this pipeline developed using
this data set can be further generalized and applied to real crime
scenes to help investigators draw conclusions based on real wire cut
data.

\section*{Methods}\label{sec-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

In this study, aluminum wire was used to create an optimal scenario
where the most amount of information could be transferred from the tool
to the substrate, despite the wire in some real cases being made of
lead. The physical property of aluminium wire make it an excellent
candidate for keeping marks while being relatively easy to bend and
non-toxic.

\subsection*{Cutting Wires}\label{sec-cutting-wires}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cutting Wires}

The aluminum wire used was 16 Gauge/1.5 mm, anodized. In order to cut
the wire, 4-inch pieces were unspooled and cut using Kaiweets wire
cutters, model KWS-105, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-plier-tip}, for 1
blade location, either inner, middle, or outer, which gives us 1
replicate. Each piece was then cut into half to create 2-inch pieces for
each side, AB and CD, with a sharpie line marking the cut ends, giving
us 4 samples. Then, we can use the standard scanning protocols for the
confocal microscope, shown in Figure Figure~\ref{fig-wire-microscope},
to scan the wire tip surfaces. The scanned surfaces are saved in a
resolution of \(0.645 \mu m \times 0.645 \mu m\) per square pixel in an
\texttt{x3p} file format. Here, we are showing AB and CD sides in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R2-4edges}, with the back of A being C and the
back of B being D. Both AB and CD sides form tent structures on the tips
of the wire, and we can separate each side of the tent into 2 pieces
along the bending position, resulting in 8 scans. We repeated this
process for all 3 locations along the blade and 5 wire cutters, with 2
replicates for each tool-edge-location combination, resulting in 120
scans. Each piece was labeled with the naming conventions, T(ool)
1/2/3/4/5 (Edge) A/B/C/D W(ire) - L(ocation) I(nner)/M(iddle)/O(uter) -
R(epetition) 1/2, with T1AW-LI-R1 being the piece cut by tool 1 on the A
edge at the inner location for the first repetition.

\subsection*{Extract Profiles}\label{sec-extract-profiles}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Extract Profiles}

Numerical comparisons between 2 replicates cannot be done directly on
the \texttt{x3p} files. We need to extract representative functions from
the scans first. A representative function with the most information is
considered as a signal for one scan, which can be used for comparison
later. To obtain this function, we first need a profile of the scan,
which is a sequence of values along a user-drawn line on the surface.
The profile should capture most features of the scan, and be orthogonal
to the striation marks of the scan, which are formed by ups and downs of
grooves. So, we draw the line across the wide region of the scan to
maximize the feature captured, as shown in dark blue in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-profiles}. We can then investigate the values
under this profile line. The profile function is along the line is
plotted in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-profiles-plot}.

\subsection*{Filtered Signals}\label{sec-filtered-signals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Filtered Signals}

With the profile extracted, we can then obtain the signal. Two Gaussian
filters as discussed in Cleveland et al.
\citep{clevelandLocalRegressionModels1992} are applied to these
resulting profiles. In particular, we first used a large low-pass filter
with bandwidths of 400 microns to remove large trend, as it can
overwhelm the signals, and then used a small high-pass filter of 40
microns to average across noise and remove spikes, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-signals-plot}.
\hh{(add reference: W. S. Cleveland, E. Grosse and W. M. Shyu (1992) Local regression models. Chapter 8 of Statistical Models in S eds J.M. Chambers and T.J. Hastie, Wadsworth \& Brooks/Cole.)}.
Finally, the extreme tail values are removed.

function in (b) and the filtered signal is obtained by using the

\subsection*{Align Signals}\label{sec-align-signals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Align Signals}

Signals extracted from different scans can be put together for
comparison, and we maximize the cross-correlation function (CCF) values
between the signals to numerically find the best alignment. For example,
we compare T1AW-LI-R1 to T1AW-LI-R2, T1CW-LI-R1 to T1CW-LI-R2, and so
on. That is comparing each row in Figure \ref{fig-scans-pair}. We know
that signals from two replicates with the same tool-edge-location
combination should yield similar signals， as in the first and second
column of Figure \ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment}, which will give
alignments of massive overlapping and high CCF values close to 1. The
alignments and values we got in the rightmost column of Figure
\ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment} fulfill our expectations.

\fi

\section*{Technical Validation}\label{sec-technical-validation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Technical Validation}

For the data collection process, two team members did the cutting and
labeling together, then one person did the scanning and named according
to the naming convention above. The scanning was done in a specific
order to ensure consistency across all scans. The data was saved in a
consistent format to ensure they could be easily accessed and analyzed.
A third person then checked the data to ensure that the data was
consistent in naming and accurate.

For the validation of the scans and their processing we investigate the
correlation scores of pair-wise aligned signals. Large scores between
signals are indicative of being made by the same tool. As showed
previously in Figure \ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment} in
\hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals}, we would expect a high
correlation score between signals from scans of wires cut with the same
tool. For signals from scans of wires cut with a different tool, we
would expect a low correlation score. For example, we have two scans
from different tools, T1AW-LI-R1 and T2AW-LI-R1, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1} and Figure~\ref{fig-T2AW-LI-R1}. The
alignment is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-T2AW-LI-R1} with 0.2
CCF value, which is low, as expected.

We also put resulting CCFs for all pairwise comparisions in the boxplot,
together with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as in
Figure \ref{fig-ccf-boxplot} and Figure \ref{fig-ccf-ROC}. We can see
that the CCF values for the same sources are close to 1, while the CCF
values for different sources are much lower than expected. This is
consistent with our expectations and validates our data processing
pipeline.

The sphere sizes are as follows: two spheres with a diameter of 3.000 mm, two spheres with a diameter of 6.000 mm, and two spheres with a diameter of 9.525 mm, and each sphere is kept in contact with its size-counterpart. By using this phantom, it becomes possible to accurately determine a known distance, specifically the centre-to-centre distance of the spheres, in a threshold-independent manner. If the measured distance deviates beyond the acceptable limits of metrological accuracy, the system’s calibration parameters are adjusted to ensure agreement between the measured distance and the actual distance.}

The \texttt{R} package
\texttt{x3ptools}\citep{hofmannX3ptoolsToolsWorking2018} available from
\texttt{CRAN} supports working with files in \texttt{x3p} format. The
sample scripts in \texttt{R} for processing scans from \texttt{x3p}
format to their signal and alignment are available on \texttt{GitHub}
\href{https://github.com/heike/wirecuts-data}{heike/wirecuts-data} in
\texttt{assessment/code} folder, as described in
Table~\ref{tbl-code-overview}.

We already conduct pairwise comparisons and visualize some of the
comparison results in \hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals} and
\hyperref[sec-technical-validation]{Technical Validation}, and we can
also produce other analysis plots.

Suppose we put the CCF values in a tilemap with different tool, location
and edge combinations. In that case, we expect only the diagonal to have
high CCF values, close to 1 and marked as orange in the tilemap, as the
diagonal represents the same source, and the rest of the matrix to have
low CCF values, close to 0 and marked as gray. In Figure
\ref{fig-ccf-tilemap}, the behavior is consistent with our expectation
overall, except for some rare cases with tool 5 edge D. The density plot
in Figure \ref{fig-ccf-density} shows the distribution of the CCF values
with the same sources and different sources. The overlapping points
between the tails of these two distributions can be a rough threshold.

Furthermore, the ROC curve in Figure \ref{fig-ccf-ROC} shows the
sensitivity / true positive rate against the false positive rate (FPR)
(1 - specificity). The curve is very close to the upper left corner,
which is excellent for classification and drawing conclusion. It gives
us a true threshold of 0.589 to control the FPR to be less than 0.05
with false negative rate (FNR) to be 0,
\tom{(false positive rate (FPR) / false discovery rate (FDR) -> define the H0 or call it false identification rate (FIR)???)},
and 0.658 to control the FPR to be less than 0.01, with FNR to be 0.02.
