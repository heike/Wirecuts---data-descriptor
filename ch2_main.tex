Wire cut data is important in forensic investigations but lacks a
systematic way of analyzing the data. We created a dataset of 120 scans
of aluminum wire cut in \texttt{x3p} format, using 5 wire cutters and 3
locations along the 4 blades, with 2 replicates for each combination. A
systematic pipeline with multiple analysis plots was developed to
analyze the data and draw conclusions based on numerical measures.

\section*{Background \& Summary}\label{sec-background-summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background \& Summary}

For forensic analysis, the investigation of marks left at crime scenes
always plays an important role, and forensic examiners are particularly
interested in identifying the origin of these marks, a process known as
the Source Identification Problem in Forensic Science
\citep{lindleyProblemForensicScience1977}. For this problem, the
forensic science community focuses on two different problems:
\textbf{specific source problem}, where examiners aim to determine if a
mark was left by a particular tool; \textbf{common source problem},
where examiners aim to determine whether two marks were left by the same
tool. Currently, the accepted practice in both problems relies on visual
inspection of the items under a comparison microscope. The results,
according to the Theory of Identification \citep{afte} developed by the
Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners (AFTE), are categorized by
examiners into three types: \emph{identification}, where the marks are
believed to be made by the same source; \emph{elimination}, where the
marks are believed to be made by different tools; and
\emph{inconclusive}, where similarities or dissimilarities between marks
are insufficient to allow either identification or elimination. However,
this classification of types is subjective if without similarity
measurements. National Research Council (NRC) \citep{nas2009} and
President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST)
\citep{pcast} criticize the absence of objectivity and the absence of
quantifiable measurements such as error rates, which highlights the need
for datasets with known ground truth for conclusion validation made
through similarity comparison.

In the forensic literature, Biedermann
\citep{biedermannStrangePersistenceSource2022} differentiates between
internal and external perspectives, where the external perspective only
allows general statements based on black-box studies that relate
examiners' conclusions to ground truth without considering any evidence
of a particular case. In order to introduce an internal perspective,
there is a need for quantitative evaluation based on specific evidence.
When analyzing wire-cut scan data, understanding the characteristics of
toolmarks left by wire cutters becomes essential. When a blade cuts a
wire, it leaves striations on the surface, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-cut-microscope}. These striations serve as evidence for
similarity assessment. Though there are already cases where the evidence
and testimony on wire cut play an important role in the criminal
investigation and defendant conviction, no publicly available dataset
currently exists for wire-cut scans, with the closest work being done by
Baiker et al. \citep{baikerToolmarkVariabilityQuality2015a}, which
focuses on screwdrivers, not wire cutters, not to mention a standardized
quantitative approach, except for visual comparisons. Thus, there is an
urgent need to collect and analyze public datasets specific to wire-cut
scans.

\caption{\label{fig-cut-microscope}Microscopic close-up of striations

\end{figure}%

Growing research has sought to develop quantitative methods for
analyzing forensic toolmarks, particularly those created by different
tools. Prior studies on striated toolmarks provide some insights into
key comparison factors, including angles of attack
\citep{baikerToolmarkVariabilityQuality2015a}, rotational axes
\citep{garciaInfluenceAxialRotation2017}, and cutting directions
\citep{cuellarAlgorithmForensicToolmark2024}. There is also foundational
research in forensic toolmarks emphasizing data collection and analysis,
including collecting and distributing datasets for bullet and toolmark
analysis
\citep{maNISTBulletSignature2004, zhengNISTBallisticsToolmark2016},
numerical methods for improving accuracy and consistency
\citep{chuAutomaticIdentificationBullet2013, vorburgerApplicationsCrosscorrelationFunctions2011},
similarity quantification techniques
\citep{hareAutomaticMatchingBullet2017, juJournalOpenSourceImplementation2022},
but alignment remains a significant challenge.

In this study, we provide a publicly available dataset of wire-cut
scans, develop a systematic pipeline to analyze the data quantitatively,
and introduce numerical measures for similarity assessment beyond visual
inspection. The dataset includes multiple types of files, as summarized
in Table~\ref{tbl-data-overview}.

\section*{Methods}\label{sec-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

In this study, we use aluminum wire to create cuts.
\hh{more details: thickness, brand?} The physical property of aluminum
wire makes it an excellent candidate for keeping marks while being
relatively easy to bend and non-toxic, i.e., with a hardness of
\hh{XXX}, aluminum is soft enough that tools leave marks but hard enough
to not be affected by handling cut materials under the microscope. In
real casework, aluminum wires are not seen as often as lead or copper.
We avoided using lead in the laboratory setting because of its toxicity.
\hh{XXX look up the hardness value of aluminum, copper, and lead.}

\subsection*{Cutting Wires}\label{sec-cutting-wires}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cutting Wires}

We used 16 Gauge/1.5 mm, anodized aluminum wire to create this wire-cut
dataset. In order to cut the wire, 4-inch pieces were unspooled and cut
using model KWS-105 Kaiweets wire cutters as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-plier-tip} for 1 blade location, either inner, middle,
or outer, which gives us 1 replicate. Each piece was then cut into half
to create 2-inch pieces for each edge, AB and CD, with a sharpie line
marking the cut ends, giving us 4 samples. Then, we follow the standard
scanning protocols for the confocal microscope, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-wire-microscope}, to scan the wire tip surfaces. The
scanned surfaces are saved in a resolution of
\(0.645 \mu m \times 0.645 \mu m\) per square pixel in an \texttt{x3p}
file format. Here, we are showing AB and CD sides in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R2-4edges}, with the back of A being C and the
back of B being D. We separate AB and CD sides into 2 pieces along the
bending position, resulting in 8 scans. Then, we repeated this process
for all 3 locations along the blade and 5 wire cutters, with 2
replicates for each tool-edge-location combination, resulting in 120
scans as our sample. Each piece was labeled following the naming
conventions: T(ool) 1/2/3/4/5 (Edge) A/B/C/D W(ire) - L(ocation)
I(nner)/M(iddle)/O(uter) - R(epetition) 1/2, with T1AW-LI-R1 being the
piece cut by tool 1 on the A edge at the inner location for the first
repetition. In order to have the sampling protocol conducted properly
without mistakes, we have two team members cut and label wires together,
and one of them scans in a specific order to ensure consistency across
all scans, and name scans by the naming convention. In the end, we have
another member checked the saved data to ensure everything was correct.

\subsection*{Extract Profiles}\label{sec-extract-profiles}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Extract Profiles}

Numerical comparisons between 2 replicates cannot be done directly on
the \texttt{x3p} files. We need to extract representative functions from
the scans first. A representative function with the most information is
considered a signal for one scan, which is used later for comparison. To
obtain this function, we first need a profile of the scan, which is a
sequence of values along a user-drawn line on the surface. The profile
captures most features of the scan and is orthogonal to the striation
marks of the scan, which are formed by the ups and downs of grooves. So,
we draw the line across the scan region to maximize the feature
captured, as shown in dark blue in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-profiles}.
We then investigate the values under this profile line. The profile
function along the line is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-profiles-plot}. This function still has to be
processed before turning into a useful signal.

\subsection*{Filtered Signals}\label{sec-filtered-signals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Filtered Signals}

With the profile extracted, we then obtain the signal. Two Gaussian
filters, as discussed in Cleveland et al.
\citep{clevelandLocalRegressionModels1992}, are applied to these
resulting profiles. In particular, we first used a large low-pass filter
with bandwidths of 400 microns to remove the large trend, as this trend
overwhelms the signals, and then used a small high-pass filter of 40
microns to average across noise and remove spikes. Finally, the extreme
tail values are removed, and the resulting signal is used for later
comparison, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-signals-plot}.

in light blue is obtained by using the low-pass filter on the profile
function in (b), and the filtered signal is obtained by using the
high-pass filter on the raw signal.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection*{Align Signals}\label{sec-align-signals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Align Signals}

After extracting signals from different scans, they are put together for
comparison, and we maximize CCF values between the signals to find the
best alignment numerically. We compare all possible pairs, for example,
T1AW-LI-R1 to T1AW-LI-R2, which is comparing each row in
Figure~\ref{fig-scans-pair}. We assume that signals from two replicates
with the same tool-edge-location combination yield relatively similar
signals, as in the first two columns of
Figure~\ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment}, which results in alignments of
massive overlapping signals and high CCF values close to 1. The
alignments and values in the rightmost column of
Figure~\ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment} fulfill our expectations.

\section*{Technical Validation}\label{sec-technical-validation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Technical Validation}

We conducted technical validation in different aspects, including
processing and alignment of signals, and variability assessment.

The validation for processing scans and alignment of signals was
conducted in the following manner. For the CCF values calculated, we
assume large values between signals from the same source and low scores
between signals from different sources.
Figure~\ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment} shown in
\hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals} before matches our thought
for signals from same sources. For different sources, we arbitrarily
take T1AW-LI-R1 and T2AW-LI-R1 as an example, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1} and Figure~\ref{fig-T2AW-LI-R1}. The signal
alignment is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-T1AW-LI-R1-T2AW-LI-R1} with a 0.2
CCF value, which is as low as expected. We also put resulting CCFs for
all pairwise comparisons in the boxplot, together with the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as in Figure~\ref{fig-ccf-boxplot}
and Figure~\ref{fig-ccf-ROC}. The ROC curve shows the sensitivity, or
the true positive rate, against the false positive rate (FPR) (1 -
specificity). This curve is very close to the upper left corner, which
is excellent for classification and drawing conclusions. It gives us a
threshold of 0.589 to control the FPR to be less than 0.05 with a false
negative rate (FNR) to be 0,
\tom{(false positive rate (FPR) / false discovery rate (FDR) -> define the H0 or call it false identification rate (FIR)???)},
and 0.658 to control the FPR to be less than 0.01, with FNR to be 0.02.
All these results are consistent with our expectations and validate our
pipeline for processing scans and alignment of signals.

The other validation we did was to assess the variability of our
pipeline. In particular, we assess the variabilities in different
replicates, staging, and acquisition. We arbitrarily picked scans from
tool 2 at the middle location for this assessment. The variability in
different replicates was shown when we took two different cuts on the
same edge and position, as fully discussed in the previous comparison as
Figure~\ref{fig-signals-pair-alignment} shown in
\hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals}. For staging, we rescanned
replicate 2 under the confocal microscope, introducing a new staging
labeled as S in our naming protocol. All scans with staging 1 are
omitted in the label, resulting in R2(-S1). For all four edges of tool 2
at the middle location, we created three different stagings, R2, R2-S2,
and R2-S3, computed the CCF between stagings with pairwise comparison,
and computed the CCF average and standard deviation (SD).

Within each staging, we further examined the effect of different
acquisitions by keeping the scans on the confocal microscope under
varying lighting conditions, introducing a new acquisition label as A.
For edge A at staging 3, we performed 4 acquisitions in total, omitting
the first one in the label again, resulting in R2-S3(-A1). For the other
three edges, we conducted two acquisitions in staging 3, denoted as
R2-S3 and R2-S3-A2. Again, we computed the CCF between stagings with
pairwise comparison and the CCF average and standard deviation.

With this setup, we expect an increasing consistency in the CCF from
replicate to staging to acquisition as conditions become progressively
more stable when scanning. Consequently, variability should decrease
along this sequence. We also computed the differences between replicate,
staging, and acquisition, expecting more minor differences between
acquisition and staging than between staging and replicate. We
visualized the results as scatter plots, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-rep_staging_acquisition}. The interval within 2 standard
deviations is also shown. There is an increase in the average, as shown
in higher orange bars, and a decrease in standard deviation, as shown in
the shorter interval width in the plot. The detailed numeric results,
including means, standard deviation, and differences in averages, are
shown in Table~\ref{tbl-CCF-replicate-staging-acquisition}, confirming
our expectations.

One thing to note is that our variability assessment does not include
variability in the CCFs due to differences in manually extracting
profiles from scans. For the purpose of reproducibility of the results
stated here, we have included the extraction location and values for
each scan.

The geometry of source to object and source to detector distances are verified whenever there is any significant physical interaction with the source such as re-alignment, change of filament, or source anode change. This calibration process involves scanning a specially designed phantom known as an ‘hourglass’36, which consists of three pairs of high-sphericity spheres. The sphere sizes are as follows: two spheres with a diameter of 3.000 mm, two spheres with a diameter of 6.000 mm, and two spheres with a diameter of 9.525 mm, and each sphere is kept in contact with its size-counterpart. By using this phantom, it becomes possible to accurately determine a known distance, specifically the centre-to-centre distance of the spheres, in a threshold-independent manner. If the measured distance deviates beyond the acceptable limits of metrological accuracy, the system’s calibration parameters are adjusted to ensure agreement between the measured distance and the actual distance.}

We already conduct pairwise comparisons and visualize some of the
comparison results in \hyperref[sec-align-signals]{Align Signals} and
\hyperref[sec-technical-validation]{Technical Validation}. Here, we
introduce some other analysis plots. Suppose we put the CCF values in a
tilemap with different tools, locations, and edge combinations. In that
case, we expect only the diagonal to have high CCF values, close to 1
and marked as orange in the tilemap, as the diagonal represents the same
source, and the rest of the matrix to have low CCF values, close to 0
and marked as gray. In Figure~\ref{fig-ccf-tilemap}, the behavior is
consistent with our expectation overall, except for some rare cases with
tool 5 edge D. The density plot in Figure~\ref{fig-ccf-density} shows
the distribution of the CCF values with the same sources and different
sources. The overlapping points between the tails of these two
distributions are a rough threshold for drawing conclusions.
