  abstract = {The consecutive matching striae (CMS) numeric criteria for firearm and toolmark identifications have been widely accepted by forensic examiners, although there have been questions concerning its observer subjectivity and limited statistical support. In this paper, based on signal processing and extraction, a model for the automatic and objective counting of CMS is proposed. The position and shape information of the striae on the bullet land is represented by a feature profile, which is used for determining the CMS number automatically. Rapid counting of CMS number provides a basis for ballistics correlations with large databases and further statistical and probability analysis. Experimental results in this report using bullets fired from ten consecutively manufactured barrels support this developed model.},

  abstract = {Local regression models provide methods for fitting regression functions, or regression surfaces, to data. The chapter describes the specifications of a particular model determine the details of the method used to fit the model; the fitting method, which is called loess. It discusses the S functions and objects for local regression models by working through a number of examples. Our goal is to show how the data are analyzed in practice using S. This means we must discuss diagnostic methods. Thus, diagnostic checking is an essential part of the practice of fitting local regression models, and, as with all model building, omitting it results in demonstrated validity being replaced simply by hope. Thus, the fitting of local regression models involves making the following choices about the specification of properties of the errors and the regression surface. Properties are Gaussian or symmetric distribution; constant variance or a priori weights; locally linear or locally quadratic in numeric predictors; and neighborhood size.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the R package cmpsR, an open-source implementation of the Congruent Matching Profile Segments (CMPS) method developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for objective comparison of striated tool marks. The functionality of the package is showcased by examples of bullet signatures that come with the package. Graphing tools are implemented in the package as well for users to assess and understand the CMPS results. Initial tests were performed on bullet signatures generated from two sets of 3D scans in the Hamby study under the framework suggested by the R package `bulletxtrctr`. New metrics based on CMPS scores are introduced and compared with existing metrics. A measure called sum of squares ratio is included, and how it can be used for evaluating different scans, metrics, or parameters is showcased with the Hamby study data sets. An open-source implementation of the CMPS algorithm makes the algorithm more accessible, generates reproducible results, and facilitates further studies of the algorithm such as method comparisons.},

  abstract = {A bullet signature measurement system based on a stylus instrument was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the signature measurements of NIST RM (Reference Material) 8240 standard bullets. The standard bullets are developed as a reference standard for bullet signature measurements and are aimed to support the recently established National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The RM bullets are designed as both a virtual and a physical bullet signature standard. The virtual standard is a set of six digitized bullet signatures originally profiled from six master bullets fired at ATF and FBI using six different guns. By using the virtual signature standard to control the tool path on a numerically controlled diamond turning machine at NIST, 40 RM bullets were produced. In this paper, a comparison parameter and an algorithm using autoand cross-correlation functions are described for qualifying the bullet signature differences between the RM bullets and the virtual bullet signature standard. When two compared signatures are exactly the same (point by point), their cross-correlation function (CCF) value will be equal to 100\%. The measurement system setup, measurement program, and initial measurement results are discussed. Initial measurement results for the 40 standard bullets, each measured at six land impressions, show that the CCF values for the 240 signature measurements are higher than 95\%, with most of them even higher than 99\%. These results demonstrate the high reproducibility for both the manufacturing process and the measurement system for the NIST RM 8240 standard bullets.},

  abstract = {We describe several examples where we use cross-correlation functions to quantify the similarity of 2D surface profiles or of 3D areal surface topography images. The applications have included (1) the manufacture of standard reference material (SRM) bullets and casings, (2) methods to assess whether bullets or casings have been fired by the same firearm, and (3) research to quantify similarities or differences between profiles of the same surface measured by different techniques or between a master surface and its replicas. The cross-correlation maximum is the functional parameter used to quantify similarity. A second parameter, called the relative profile (2D) difference or relative areal topography (3D) difference, may also be used to quantify differences and to recognize the ambiguous condition when two results have different vertical (z-) scales but identical shapes. Most of these examples have been applied in support of ballistics inspection methods in crime labs, but the methods are generally useful for estimating the accuracy of surface replication techniques or the ability of different surface topography instruments to measure the same surface and provide the same result. The instruments used in these studies were a stylus instrument and a Nipkow-disk type confocal microscope. Cross-correlation functions may also be used to assess differences resulting from the use of different filters to modify the same surface profile or topography image.},
