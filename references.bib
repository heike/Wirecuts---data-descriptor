  abstract = {The traditional way of visual toolmark comparison includes subjective judgments. Automated methods using computers are a possibility to render a comparison more objective, but they require the statistical properties, like the similarity and variability, of toolmarks to be determined quantitatively. Several parameters, that play a role during toolmark creation, are statistically analyzed in this article. We determined the same toolmark and the different toolmark similarity as well as variability of known matching toolmarks created in wax and compared the results with the similarity and variability of known non-matching toolmarks. In addition we studied the influence of the substrate materials wax and lead and the angle of attack on toolmark similarity and variability. Furthermore, we present an approach to determine toolmark quality, defined as how well structural details are preserved in the toolmark, to assist toolmark examiners in deciding, which structural details are reliable in a mark. We studied the influence of the substrate material, the angle of attack and the depth of a toolmark on the quality. The results show that for known matching toolmarks, the variability is very low within a toolmark and between toolmarks in wax, given that the parameters angle of attack and depth are held constant. Geometrical details are reliably represented down to 10--50{$\mu$}m and toolmark similarity is clearly higher than known non-matching similarities. The comparison of wax and lead shows that wax is a good alternative as a substrate material for experimental toolmarks, capable of reliably representing structural details down to 10--25{$\mu$}m. For finer details, lead is a better choice but might alter the original state of a tool. With increasing angle of attack, toolmark variability increases and toolmark quality decreases. Therefore it is advantageous to push the tool instead of pulling during toolmark creation for angles of attack above {$\approx$}45{$^\circ$}. The quality also decreases with increasing toolmark depth, but only up to {$\approx$}300{$\mu$}m. Therefore toolmarks should be created as shallow as possible in the substrate material.},

  abstract = {Many forensic scientists consider that identification (individualisation) -- in the sense of statements of the kind ``the questioned item and the known item come from the same source'' -- is a concept that is central to their discipline. This is so despite decade-long, fundamental critiques levelled by both practitioners and academics against the conceptual and practical feasibility of forensic identification. Oddly, there is a constant stream of publications in (peer-reviewed) forensic science journals that treat forensic identification axiomatically as a valid object of study, sidestepping the fundamental critiques. This paper reviews and discusses three exemplary strands of publications that exemplify this persistent trend. These strands are called descriptivism, diagnosticism and machinism. The latter term refers to methods borrowed from the now increasingly popular approaches used in the field of machine learning. In turn, descriptivism and diagnosticism refer to general design aspects of mainstream research methods, illustrated here through a critical review of two recent papers on, respectively, forensic odontology and a framework for interpreting fingerprint evidence. The critique of the use of `identification' in these strands of publication includes, but goes beyond, semantic details and the reiteration of long-known shortcomings of obsolete technical language such as `match' and `matching'. Specifically, this paper exposes deeper problems such as the subtle and argumentatively unfounded carrying-over of source conclusions to ultimate issues and the use probability concepts for questions that require more than the mere quantification of uncertainty. This paper submits that in order to foster trust in an era of continually expanding publishing activities, it should be a vital interest to forensic science journals to better examine what identification-related research can and cannot legitimately purport to achieve.},

In this paper, based on signal processing and extraction, a model for the automatic and objective counting of CMS is proposed. The position and shape information of the striae on the bullet land is represented by a feature profile, which is used for determining the CMS number automatically. Rapid counting of CMS number provides a basis for ballistics correlations with large databases and further statistical and probability analysis. Experimental results in this report using bullets fired from ten consecutively manufactured barrels support this developed model.},

The chapter describes the specifications of a particular model determine the details of the method used to fit the model; the fitting method, which is called loess. It discusses the S functions and objects for local regression models by working through a number of examples. Our goal is to show how the data are analyzed in practice using S. This means we must discuss diagnostic methods. Thus, diagnostic checking is an essential part of the practice of fitting local regression models, and, as with all model building, omitting it results in demonstrated validity being replaced simply by hope. Thus, the fitting of local regression models involves making the following choices about the specification of properties of the errors and the regression surface. Properties are Gaussian or symmetric distribution; constant variance or a priori weights; locally linear or locally quadratic in numeric predictors; and neighborhood size.},

  abstract = {Forensic toolmark analysis traditionally relies on subjective human judgment, leading to inconsistencies and lack of transparency. The multitude of variables, including angles and directions of mark generation, further complicates comparisons. To address this, we first generate a dataset of 3D toolmarks from various angles and directions using consecutively manufactured slotted screwdrivers. By using PAM clustering, we find that there is clustering by tool rather than angle or direction. Using Known Match and Known Non-Match densities, we establish thresholds for classification. Fitting Beta distributions to the densities, we allow for the derivation of likelihood ratios for new toolmark pairs. With a cross-validated sensitivity of 98~\% and specificity of 96~\%, our approach enhances the reliability of toolmark analysis. This approach is applicable to slotted screwdrivers, and for screwdrivers that are made with a similar production method. With data collection of other tools and factors, it could be applied to compare toolmarks of other types. This empirically trained, open-source solution offers forensic examiners a standardized means to objectively compare toolmarks, potentially decreasing the number of miscarriages of justice in the legal system.},

  abstract = {A bullet signature measurement system based on a stylus instrument was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the signature measurements of NIST RM (Reference Material) 8240 standard bullets. The standard bullets are developed as a reference standard for bullet signature measurements and are aimed to support the recently established National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The RM bullets are designed as both a virtual and a physical bullet signature standard. The virtual standard is a set of six digitized bullet signatures originally profiled from six master bullets fired at ATF and FBI using six different guns. By using the virtual signature standard to control the tool path on a numerically controlled diamond turning machine at NIST, 40 RM bullets were produced. In this paper, a comparison parameter and an algorithm using autoand cross-correlation functions are described for qualifying the bullet signature differences between the RM bullets and the virtual bullet signature standard. When two compared signatures are exactly the same (point by point), their cross-correlation function (CCF) value will be equal to 100\%. The measurement system setup, measurement program, and initial measurement results are discussed. Initial measurement results for the 40 standard bullets, each measured at six land impressions, show that the CCF values for the 240 signature measurements are higher than 95\%, with most of them even higher than 99\%. These results demonstrate the high reproducibility for both the manufacturing process and the measurement system for the NIST RM 8240 standard bullets.},

The cross-correlation maximum is the functional parameter used to quantify similarity. A second parameter, called the relative profile (2D) difference or relative areal topography (3D) difference, may also be used to quantify differences and to recognize the ambiguous condition when two results have different vertical (z-) scales but identical shapes. Most of these examples have been applied in support of ballistics inspection methods in crime labs, but the methods are generally useful for estimating the accuracy of surface replication techniques or the ability of different surface topography instruments to measure the same surface and provide the same result. The instruments used in these studies were a stylus instrument and a Nipkow-disk type confocal microscope. Cross-correlation functions may also be used to assess differences resulting from the use of different filters to modify the same surface profile or topography image.},
